## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the discord bot [Rankore](https://github.com/fulviodenza/rankore), a bot to track the activity of the users, and on [WiseCart](https://github.com/Phenixis/wisecart_2.0), an app that saves you time by using a meal-oriented approach to generating your shopping lists.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a web app using NextJS
- 🎯 My goal is to fail 50 times at creating a useful app (I'll eventually succeed at least once)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love baguette 🇫🇷
