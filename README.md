## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the discord bot [Rankore](https://github.com/fulviodenza/rankore), a bot to track the activity of the users, and on [WiseCart](https://github.com/Phenixis/wisecart_2.0), an app that saves you time by using a meal-oriented approach to generating your shopping lists.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build a web app using NextJS
- ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to fail 50 times at creating a useful app (I'll eventually succeed at least once)
