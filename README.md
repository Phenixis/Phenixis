## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a NextJs Boilerplate titled [Boilerplate.md](https://github.com/Phenixis/boilerplate.md), to build a professionnal app without dealing with the fluff.
- ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to fail 50 times at creating a useful app (I'll eventually succeed at least once)
